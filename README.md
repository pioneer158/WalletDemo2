# Google Wallet Samples

This project contains samples for using the [Google Wallet REST APIs](https://developers.google.com/wallet/) in the following languages:

- Java
- C#
- JavaScript (Node.js)
- PHP
- Python

Within each language's directory, you'll find standalone samples for each of the pass types supported by the Google Wallet APIs.

Each sample demonstrates the following:

- Authenticating using a Google Cloud service account
- Creating Pass Classes
- Creating/retrieving Pass Objects
- Creating a signed JWT for use in a "Add to Google Wallet" URL

## Contributing

Please note that the samples are automatically generated using templates found in the "templates" directory, where you will also find the "generate.py" script that generates the samples. If contributing any changes, please work on the files in this directory.
